    analysis. The prover is written in the Mathematica language and
    runs in the Mathematica environment. The goal of the project
    is to use a powerful symbolic computation system to prove theorems

    The theorem prover is also able to deduce the correctness of
    certain simplification steps that would otherwise not be performed.
    We describe the structure of Analytica and explain the main techniques
    that it uses to construct proofs. Analytica has been able to
    prove several nontrivial theorems. In this paper, we show how
    it can prove a series of lemmas that lead to the Bernstein approximation
