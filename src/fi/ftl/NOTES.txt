Main differences with modal FTL
-------------------------------

syntax_.sig     defines type nat_ (naturals) along with
                - z_ : zero
                - s_ : successor
                - eq_ : equality
                - allN_ : universal quantifier for naturals --- cannot use all_
                          because of typing problems
                - allU_ : universal quantifier for users --- ditto (it is the old
                          plain all_)
                - someN_ and someU_ : ditto
                - operators next_, boxt_, until_ and wuntil_
compound_tacs   no more iterative-deepening stuff
basic_tacs      - a simple tactic, isol, to weaken repeatedly and isolate relevant
                  formulae in sequents
                - rules and tactics for new operators
                - some more rules for generative operators (marked with a 2) in
                  which it is possible to specify the time constant to use
                  (useful for proof presentation)

General notes
-------------

. we use a slightly uncommon definition of the until operator. Basically
  we assume that p also holds at the time q holds: this seems to make
  easier and more intuitive the modelling of transition systems.
