This list contains files in canonical truename format

Whenever a new file is being processed, it gets added to this list

When the prover retracts a file, this list is resynchronised via the
proof-shell-retract-files-regexp and proof-shell-compute-new-files-list 
configuration settings.

Only files which have been *fully* processed should be included here.
Proof General itself will automatically add the filenames of a script
buffer which has been completely read when scripting is deactivated.
It will automatically remove the filename of a script buffer which
is completely unread when scripting is deactivated.

NB: Currently there is no generic provision for removing files which
are only partly read-in due to an error, so ideally the proof assistant
should only output a processed message when a file has been successfully
read.")
