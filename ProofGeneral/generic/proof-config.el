;; This file declares all user options and prover-specific
;; configuration variables for Proof General.  The variables
;; are used variously by the proof script mode and the 
;; proof shell mode, menus, and toolbar.
;; 
;; To customize Proof General for a new proof assistant, you
;; should read this file carefully!

;;  4. Script mode configuration

;;  8. X-Symbol support
;;  9. Prover specific settings [NEW in 3.2 -- using new mechanism]
;; 10. Global constants 
;;
;; The user options don't need to be set on a per-prover basis,
;; and the global constants probably should not be touched.
;; The remaining variables in sections 2-9 should be set for

;; for basic functionality; consult the manual for details of
;; which ones are important.

;; ==================================================
;;
;; Developers notes:
;;   i. When adding a new configuration variable, please
;;       (a) put it in the right customize group, and
;;       (b) add a magical comment in NewDoc.texi to document it!
;;  ii. Presently the customize library seems a bit picky over the
;;    	:type property and some correct but complex types don't work 
;;	properly.
;;    	If the type is ill-formed, editing the whole group will be broken.
;;    	Check after updates, by killing all customize buffers and
;;    	invoking customize-group

Proof General lets the user send arbitrary commands to the proof

If you change proof-strict-read-only during a session, you must 
use the \"Restart\" button (or M-x proof-shell-restart) before
you can see the effect in buffers.

The default value for proof-strict-read-only depends on which

Setting this option triggers a three-buffer mode of interaction where
the goals buffer and response buffer are both displayed, rather than
the two-buffer mode where they are switched between.  It also prevents
Emacs automatically resizing windows between proof steps.

Proof General insists that only one script buffer can be partly
processed: all others have to be completely processed or completely

This hook is called inside a save-excursion with the proof-shell-buffer 
current, just before inserting and sending the text in the 
variable `string'.  The hook can massage `string' or insert additional 
text directly into the proof-shell-buffer.  
Before sending `string', it will be stripped of carriage returns.

Additionally, the hook can examine the variable `action'.  It will be
a symbol, set to the callback command which is executed in the proof
shell filter once `string' has been processed.  The `action' variable
suggests what class of command is about to be inserted:
  
 'proof-done-invisible	     A non-scripting command
 'proof-done-advancing	     A \"forward\" scripting command
 'proof-done-retracting	     A \"backward\" scripting command

Caveats: You should be very careful about setting this hook.  Proof
General relies on a careful synchronization with the process between
inputs and outputs.  It expects to see a prompt for each input it
sends from the queue.  If you add extra input here and it causes more
prompts than expected, things will break!  Extending the variable
`string' may be safer than inserting text directly, since it is
stripped of carriage returns before being sent.

LEGO uses this hook for setting the pretty printer width if

Plastic uses it to remove literate-style markup from `string'.
