;;DEPENDENCY INFORMATION


;;The following functions are responsible for updated the dependencies
;;and dependents information for each span and updating the two
;;variables above.

;;dependencies-within-file-list is called in proof-script.el within
;;the function proof-done-advancing.  This function is called every
;;time a span is completed.  It will set the result of
;;dependencies-within-file-list to the span-property
;;dependencies-within-file which can then be called.
;;dependencies-within-file-list takes the list of dependencies
;;returned by Isabelle and filters them to return only those
;;dependencies that are in the same file as the span.

;;update-dependents is also called in proof-done-advancing and is
;;passed the result of dependencies-within-file-list.  This function
;;will recurse over this list and for each element will check if it is
;;a span.  Depending on this, the function then calls either
;;update-depts-thy or update-depts-ml which both add SPAN-NAME to the
;;dependents list of the first element of the list, which is classed
;;as either a span or a definition.  They then update the relevant
;;variable (see above).

;;Note: this is not ideal as there are some objects, such as ml
;;commands like [Addsimps] which are neither spans nor definitions.
;;These are classed as definitions as they fail the span test but
;;ideally they should be filtered out.

;;MENU FUNCTIONS

;;The following functions set up the menus which are the key way in
;;which the dependency information is used.

;;There are three menus; one which appears when the user right-clicks
;;in a span, one when the user right-clicks outside a span in the ML
;;file and one when the user right-clicks in the theory file.

;;***************
;;SPAN MENUS


;;The menu below appears when the user right-clicks in a span.  This
;;is taken as an event; the event is passed to span-context-menu which
;;sets the span as event-span and calls the creation of the
;;span-context-menu.  Span-context-menu-keymap defines a keymap
;;whereby button 3 causes this menu to appear.

;;Note: there are two functions on this menu which are not defined as
;;yet; this functionality will hopefully be added soon.

;;the following items build up list of the form ("name" ["subname" action t] ... ["subnamex" actionx t]) which is passed back to create-in-span-context-menu.  This is a way of building up the menu when not all of the informatino is known initially; this setup means `action' will only be called when that menu item is chosen and the information need not be known when the menu is set up.  "name" is typically a command such as "Move to span" and "subname" is typically the name of, in this case, a span that can be chosen to move to.  `action' must contain all the information that is needed to call the particular function without any further evaluation; for example, (unhighlight "loading.ML") is a correct possibility, (unhighlight file) is not because file is not evaluated.

;;If the list returned will be empty then each function returns just a
;;string containing the name of the command, such as "Move to span";
;;this causes it to appear in the menu as unselectable text so that
;;the user can see it is not an appropriate command.

;;make-depcs-list returns a sublist consisting of two further sublists
;;because it is convenient in this case to distinguish between spans
;;and dependencies.

;;**********************
;;ML-FILE MENU


;;The following functions define the menu that appears in the ml file
;;outwith a span.

;;Since there is already a menu defined here that we wish to add to
;;rather than replace, it is not necessary to set up the event as
;;above.  Rather, we simply indicate that proof-menu-define-deps
;;belongs to proof-mode-map.  Everytime the function
;;proof-done-advancing in proof-script.el (see above) is called, the
;;span information gets updated and we wish to re-evaluate this menu.
;;This is because this menu contains items such as move to spans,
;;where we require an up to date list of all spans.  Since we wish
;;this menu to be available at any point rather than just at the end
;;this process is done incrementally.

;;So everytime proof-done-advancing is called, proof-deps-menu (the
;;name of the menu created by proof-menu-define-deps) is removed from
;;proof-mode-map, if it exists, and once the span working has been
;;done proof-menu-define-deps is re-evaluted and the new value is then
;;added to proof-deps-menu.  All this is done in proof-script.el.

;;***************************************************************************
;;HIGHLIGHTING FUNCTIONS


;;The following functions are responsible for actually highlighting
;;the data and are called by the functions in the menu section when
;;they are setting up the submenus.

;;They work by immediately unhighlighting all highlighting that exists
;;at present and then working through a given list of spans setting
;;the span's face property to the appropriate colour.  These colours
;;are defined in proof-config.el.  The given list is calculated from
;;dependents/dependency information.


;;Some of the functions are passed only a file and calculate
;;information using the event file; these are those that are called
;;from the span-context menu and hence a current event-span is set.
;;Others are passed a particular span or span-name; these are called
;;from the ml and thy menus when there is no event-span and
;;information can be returned about any span.

;;In most cases these functions will merely highlighting the
;;appropriate spans and return nothing; the exception is
;;highlight-depcs-of-span-it.  This is unusual in that it is called
;;when there is sometimes no highlighting to be done.  Dependency
;;information contains both spans and defintions, but highlighting is
;;inappropriate for a definition because it would merely mean
;;highlighting the whole of the theory file; the theory file is not
;;divided into spans.  Therefore a message is returned to explain to
;;the user why no dependency information is highlighted even there
;;dependencies within the file exist.
