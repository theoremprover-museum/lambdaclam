;; Implementing the process lock
;;
;; da: In fact, there is little need for a lock.  Since Emacs Lisp
;; code is single-threaded, a loop parsing process output cannot get
;; pre-empted by the user trying to send more input to the process,
;; or by the process filter trying to deal with more output.
;; (Moreover, we can tell when the process is busy because the 
;; queue is non-empty).
;;
;;

;;
;; We have two functions:
;;
;;  proof-shell-ready-prover   
;;    starts proof shell, gives error if it's busy.
;;
;;  proof-activate-scripting  (in proof-script.el)
;;    calls proof-shell-ready-prover, and turns on scripting minor
;;    mode for current (scripting) buffer.
;;
;; Also, a new enabler predicate:
;;  
;;  proof-shell-available
;;    returns non-nil if a proof shell is active and not locked.

;; Maybe proof-shell-ready-prover doesn't need to start the shell?
